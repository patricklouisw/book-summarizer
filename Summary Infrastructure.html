communication and expression are both enabled and constrained by new digital systems
and new media.</mark><mark>In these environments, platform-based services acquire characteristics

Until recently, scholars of media have been satisfied with a short list of objects of study.For researchers interested in conduit and not content, each medium was a technology and
also a surrounding “environment” (Meyrowitz, 1997: 60) of objects, audiences, produc-
ers, distributors, laws, communities, and companies.Every medium proved capacious
and lasting as a category and created its own tradition of inquiry: radio studies, film stud-
ies, telecommunications, television studies, and computer-mediated communication.The advent of digital technologies and the Internet challenged this epistemology.Increasingly subdivided media objects seemed to require an increasingly subdivided
media theory.For example, video games were initially categorized as “interactive
television,” but when the characteristics of video games diverged from those of televi-
sion, this term became ungainly, and specific research emerged to target the new media
object.Similarly, Tinder, electronic mail (email), and numerically controlled machine
tools all involve “computing,” but it is not obvious that they should all be analyzed in the
same way.Scholars turned to new concepts to acknowledge the heterogeneity of media.<mark>Two theoretical approaches have emerged as potential candidates to contain and charac-
terize the new digital objects of study in the media landscape: infrastructure studies, emerg-
ing from science and technology studies and information science, and platform studies,
centered in media studies.</mark>The former has focused on analyzing essential, widely shared
sociotechnical systems.<mark>Using case studies ranging from electric power grids (Hughes,
1983) to communication networks (Graham and Marvin, 2001) to scientific “cyberinfra-
structures” (Edwards et al., 2007), this school of thought has highlighted key features of
infrastructure such as ubiquity, reliability, invisibility, gateways, and breakdown.</mark>By con-
trast, platform studies explores how computing devices (such as Intel-chip-based PCs) and
software environments (such as gaming systems) affect the characteristics of application
software built upon them.<mark>In media studies, the concept of “platform” has been extended
from game design (Montfort and Bogost, 2009) to content-sharing websites (Gillespie,
2010; Helmond, 2015) and social media applications (Langlois and Elmer, 2013; van
Dijck, 2013).</mark>Key features discussed in platform studies include programmability,
affordances and constraints, connection of heterogeneous actors, and accessibility of data
and logic through application programming interfaces (APIs).Both infrastructure and platform refer to structures that underlie or support something
more salient.Yet their different conceptual frameworks and separate origins obscure the
relationship between them.Are the infrastructure and platform perspectives complemen-
tary, opposed, or completely unrelated?Or do they overlap, revealing different aspects or
elements of the same set of objects?Do they describe different stages on a timeline in
which some platforms evolve into infrastructures, or do they oscillate over time in some
pendular cycle?Consider Google, which we analyze in greater depth below.Google exemplifies fea-
tures found in both literatures.<mark>Apps such as Google Maps can be considered program-
mable platforms on which users and developers can build new digital objects.</mark><mark>At the
same time, Google’s web search has become so ubiquitous and deeply embedded that it
could be seen as an infrastructure: robust, widely shared, widely accessible, and essen-
tial.</mark>Any breakdown in Google’s services would substantially disrupt daily life and work.<mark>What is Google, then: a platform?</mark><mark>An infrastructure?</mark>Is it sequentially or simultaneously
both?Plantin et al.295

Here, we demonstrate that cross-articulating these two perspectives can improve our
understanding of digital media.After reviewing both literatures, we show that bounda-
ries between the two perspectives have become increasingly blurry.<mark>Digital technologies
have made possible a “platformization” of infrastructure and an “infrastructuralization”
of platforms.</mark>Articulating the two perspectives highlights the tensions arising when
media environments increasingly essential to our daily lives (infrastructures) are domi-
nated by corporate entities (platforms).<mark>Next using case studies of Facebook and Google,
we demonstrate that infrastructure studies provides a valuable comparative approach to
widely accessible services of broad public value, a perspective not provided by platform
studies.</mark>At the same time, platform studies, with its focus on rapidly evolving digital
artifacts, shows how expression, communication, and knowledge are constrained within
profit-driven corporate ecosystems.We conclude by underlining the potential of this
combined framework for future research.<mark>Digital environments in infrastructure and platform studies

Infrastructure studies: from systems to networks to webs

Infrastructure studies developed along two main intellectual lines.</mark>The first sought a
historical perspective on large technical systems (LTS).Historians and sociologists used
that perspective to analyze systems ranging from electric power grids to telephone net-
works to air traffic control (Biker et al., 1987; Hughes, 1983; Mayntz and Hughes,
1988).In this perspective, infrastructures often originate as sociotechnical systems that
are centrally designed and controlled, typically in the invention and development phases
of new technologies.In these phases, they remain the province of their developer(s),
whether a single individual, a team, or an enterprise.Once these systems begin to travel
in physical and social space, they also begin to change.Both users and other developers
may modify or extend them while competing technologies and enterprises arise; consider
the many similar, but incompatible devices and standards developed during the early
days of railroads, electric power, or digital computers.Consequently, when a need arises
to link heterogeneous systems into networks, devices, and/or social apparatuses known
as gateways—for example, AC/DC power converters, software/hardware combinations
such as Ethernet, and legal arrangements such as international trade law (Egyedi, 1996;
Egyedi and Spirco, 2011)—must be created.The network phase signals not only the
involvement of many more actors but also growing social commitments manifested in,
for example, explicit standards, user habituation, and organizational routines.Some
infrastructures, such as electric utilities or postal services, acquire the character of public
goods, with governments or highly regulated monopoly firms taking responsibility for
development, operations, and/or maintenance.In later phases of development, webs or internetworks (networks of heterogeneous
networks) may form.For example, trucking, rail, and shipping networks developed inde-
pendently, but were later integrated into a global internetwork by means of the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard shipping container, a clas-
sic example of a gateway (Busch, 2011; Egyedi, 2001; Klose, 2015).The Internet itself
is a network of heterogeneous computer networks, made possible by the Transmission
296 new media & society 20(1)

Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).Because they integrate many semi-inde-
pendent systems, internetworks can only rarely be designed, controlled, or standardized
from above (Edwards et al., 2007); instead, fully developed infrastructures are complex
ecologies whose components must continually adapt to each other’s ongoing change.In
a final, devolutionary phase, infrastructures can splinter into more specialized elements
or die altogether (Graham and Marvin, 2001; van der Vleuten, 2004).A second intellectual stream in infrastructure studies, championed by Star and
Bowker, elaborated the phenomenology and sociology of infrastructures (Edwards et al.,
2007, 2009; Graham and Marvin, 2001; Ribes and Finholt, 2009; Star and Ruhleder,
1996).They articulated, for example, interacting dependencies on infrastructures, which
create potentials for social chaos during episodes of breakdown, such as urban blackouts
or major Internet outages.Dependency stems from the qualities of ubiquity, reliability,
and especially durability; major infrastructures such as railroads, telephone networks,
Linnaean taxonomy, and the Internet endure over many decades, even centuries.As a
result, infrastructures are “learned as part of membership” in communities, nations, and
lifeworlds (Bowker and Star, 1999; Edwards, 2002).<mark>This stream of infrastructure studies
emphasizes the critical role of infrastructure’s human elements, such as work practices,
individual habits, and organizational culture, as well as the ways an infrastructure can
structurally exclude some people (e.g.</mark>deaf, blind, or wheelchair-bound individuals)
from purportedly “universal” services (Lee et al., 2006; Ribes and Bowker, 2008; Ribes
and Finholt, 2009).<mark>Platform studies: from programmability to application ecologies

The study of platforms is a more recent and more cacophonous endeavor.</mark><mark>The com-
puter industry adopted the term “platform” in the mid-1990s, when Microsoft described
Windows as a platform and Netscape defined a “cross-platform” strategy for its web
browser.</mark>Management and organization studies researchers identified platforms as
critically important for both digital and non-digital industries.For these scholars and
the business cultures they examined, platforms are architectures comprising three key
elements: core components with low variability, complementary components with
high variability, and interfaces for modularity between core and complementary com-
ponents (Baldwin and Woodward, 2008).Such architecture can lower the cost of inno-
vation because it avoids building an entirely new system for each new product (Baldwin
and Woodward, 2008: 8-9).<mark>For management and organization studies, then, platforms
constitute a powerful model for innovative products, with direct applications to digital
media.</mark><mark>Media scholars’ interest in digital platforms coincides with the rise of “Web 2.0”
(O’Reilly, 2005) in the mid-2000s.</mark><mark>Researchers studying the Web extended the computer
industry’s notion of platform to web-based applications whose technical architecture
emphasizes the provision of connection, programmability, and data exchange with appli-
cations developed by others.</mark>Products of this interoperability came to be known as
“mashups,” in which a new application or service is created by aggregating two or more
data sources.Scholars soon began to interrogate the political and cultural implications of
these participatory forms of production and remix of content.Precursors to platform

Plantin et al.<mark>297

studies include Benkler’s (2006) investigation of peer production in the “networked pub-
lic sphere” and Jenkins’ (2006) study of how digital remixing practices alter the tradi-
tional boundary between producers and consumers of cultural content.</mark><mark>Platform studies scholars similarly focus on participatory media practices, but
acknowledge more directly the dual nature of commercial platforms: their affordances
support innovation and creativity—supplying a base for video games or new media
forms—yet simultaneously constrain participation and channel it into modes that profit
the platform’s creators.</mark>According to Bogost and Montfort, platforms’ essential charac-
teristic is the programmability which permits users to go beyond the original designers’
project.<mark>A sound bite states, “If you can program it, it’s a platform.</mark>If you can’t, it’s not”
(Andreessen, 2007, quoted in Bogost and Montfort, 2009).This usage of “platform” is
clearly compatible with the management and organization studies usage mentioned
above; Montfort and Bogost essentially describe the 1977 Atari Video Computer System
(VCS) as a core component whose interchangeable game cartridges act as complemen-
tary components—a groundbreaking rupture with that era’s hulking wooden-cabinet
arcade machines, each of which offered just one game.In some of this scholarship, the analysis of platform architecture and design is com-
plemented by a focus on users’ agency as expressed in the economic and legal character-
istics of platforms.Here, cultural studies and political economy meet, exploring
individual expressions while interrogating the power relations typical of commercial
platforms.<mark>José van Dijck, for example, defines platforms as a “set of relations that con-
stantly needs to be performed,” in part due to continual friction between, on one side,
users’ goals of expression and, on the other side, platforms’ profit-seeking aims and the
legal surround that defines legitimate use (van Dijck, 2013: 26).</mark><mark>Similarly, Langlois and
Elmer critically assess “some of the new forms of power yielded by corporate social
media platforms” such as Facebook (Langlois and Elmer, 2013: 14).</mark>Economic interests,
they write, affect the design of social media interfaces (e.g.integrated systems for dis-
playing online ads targeted to individual users).More fundamentally, social media plat-
forms bind pre-defined communicative acts to an economic logic.<mark>For example, “like,”
“share,” and “retweet” not only provide a means for users to express themselves but also
facilitate ranking, product recommendations, and data analytics.</mark><mark>Analyzing corporate
social media platforms therefore requires researchers to investigate these “double articu-
lations” (Langlois and Elmer, 2013).</mark><mark>For example, corporations’ goal of gathering users’
personal data determines the technical properties of platforms, which in turn shapes how
they organize communication among users.</mark>Gillespie similarly analyzes the tensions between agency and architecture in plat-
forms by studying how the legal constructions and technical affordances of digital inter-
mediaries shape public discourse.<mark>Using YouTube as a case study, he highlights how
social media companies deploy the term “platform” to position themselves as neutral
facilitators and to downplay their own agency: “platform” is “specific enough to mean
something, and vague enough to work across multiple venues for multiple audiences”
(Gillespie, 2010), such as developers, users, and advertisers.</mark>Recent debates about the
legal responsibilities of Uber and AirBnB illustrate this strategy: the firms present
themselves as platforms, “merely” connecting car or property owners with potential
customers.<mark>298 new media & society 20(1)

To summarize, platform studies scholars explore how modularity and power are nego-
tiated between a core unit with low variability and heterogeneous components of high
variability.</mark>Their perspective is cultural, economic, and critical, forming a continuum
ranging from cultural studies to political economy.Collectively, they highlight how plat-
forms’ affordances simultaneously allow and constrain expression, as well as how tech-
nical, social, and economic concerns determine platforms’ structure, function, and use.<mark>Beyond the specific frame of platform studies, the dialogue between infrastructure
studies and media studies writ large is already considerable.</mark><mark>The “new materialists”
(Sandvig, 2013) comprise scholars focusing on how media infrastructures interact with
media cultures.</mark><mark>Scholarship on cinema networks in urban Nigeria (Larkin, 2008), under-
sea Internet cable networks (Starosielski, 2015), or the cultural imaginaries of data cent-
ers (Hu, 2015) illustrate this rising body of scholarship on “media infrastructures” (Parks
and Starosielski, 2015).</mark>We describe next how we take part in this cross-disciplinary
articulation.Platformized infrastructures and infrastructuralized
platforms

The brief overview offered above cannot possibly do justice to the richness of these two
approaches.Instead, we have deliberately emphasized the historicist component of infra-
structure studies and the critical focus of platform studies.In this section, we combine
these two frameworks, putting the rise of platforms into historical context while high-
lighting their consequences for communication, expression, and knowledge.<mark>We argue
that the rise of digital technologies, in a neoliberal, political, and economic climate, has
simultaneously facilitated a “platformization” of infrastructures and an “infrastructurali-
zation” of platforms.</mark><mark>A historical and critical perspective on the rise of platforms

Moving towards a combined framework, we first need to describe the difference between
platform builders and the “system builders” central to Thomas Hughes and the STS
theory of infrastructure we described earlier.</mark>One might regard the former as an instance
of the latter, except for one key difference: unlike system builders, platform builders do
not seek to internalize their environments through vertical integration.Instead, their plat-
forms are designed to be extended and elaborated from outside, by other actors, provided
that those actors follow certain rules.Platforms such as Apple’s iOS (iPhone operating
system) or Google’s Android achieve their success precisely by attracting many inde-
pendent actors to contribute to their software ecologies, instead of attempting to build
and market stand-alone products.<mark>Users benefit from the platform’s standardized inter-
face, while independent developers benefit from the platform’s code base, large audi-
ence, and marketing power.</mark>Meanwhile, the platform builder reaps profits due to
increased buy-in (or lock-in) by both sides.The costs of this approach, as platform stud-
ies has shown, come in the form of constraints, constant revisions forced by platform
updates, and lock-in to the platform’s conception of users, functionality, and design val-
ues.<mark>Finally, because achieving lock-in is among platform builders’ principal goals, most

concept—which might permit interoperability with competitors.This strategy forces
independent developers either to commit to just one platform or to build and maintain
multiple versions of the same product.As characterized in the literatures reviewed above, platforms and infrastructures have
some similarities, but they differ in scale and scope.Evolving from systems to networks
to webs, infrastructures integrate many heterogeneous components by means of socio-
technical gateways.As essential elements of everyday life and work, many infrastruc-
tures are widely accessible, some to the extent of being funded, managed, and/or
regulated by governments.In general, platforms are built with smaller scales and scopes
in view.Platform builders seek to create modular frameworks.The platform remains a
centrally controlled and designed system (often under corporate control), but benefits
from the innovations of a large penumbra of third-party developers.Table | presents these concepts as mostly distinct, but it also shows respects in which
they overlap.As we will now discuss, these boundaries have become increasingly blurry.<mark>Platforms rise when infrastructures splinter

Perhaps unsurprisingly, both computer industry and media studies’ ideas about platforms
originated in a period when the phenomenon Graham and Marvin (2001) have called the
300 new media & society 20(1)

“modern infrastructural ideal” was disappearing.</mark>Their felicitous phrase calls out the
tacit, imperfectly realized, yet widespread ideal, originating around the middle of the
19th century, of cities as coherent units responsible for providing certain services to all
citizens, for example, roads, sewers, emergency services, and public transportation.Many of these infrastructures originated as private enterprises, later acquiring the status
of publicly regulated monopolies.Around the same time, national governments also
became involved in the provision and/or regulation of railroads, major highways, post/
telegraph/telephone, and other infrastructures—including the early Internet.Starting in
the late 1970s, however, the modern infrastructural ideal began to collapse as neoliberal
leaders sought to lower costs through market competition.Many infrastructures under-
went deregulation and/or privatization during the Thatcher—Reagan era; as a result, they
often “splintered” into numerous enterprises.The government’s role was no longer to run
or oversee monopoly providers of public goods, but rather the reverse: to break those
monopolies apart so as to increase competition while renouncing many of the responsi-
bilities implied by the modern infrastructural ideal.This strategy often produced effi-
ciencies, but it also resulted in tiered structures of vestigial, poorly functioning services
for low-income citizens alongside premium services for the wealthy.A striking view of the modern infrastructural ideal’s decline, and its replacement by
fragmented, privatized, yet interoperable systems and services, can be seen in the history
of networked computing.In the 1960s, the rising sense that computer power might
become a significant resource for large numbers of people led numerous analysts to the
concept of “computer utility.” Computer utility would build and operate giant computers
whose central processing unit (CPU) time could be shared, in the same way that electric
utility customers share huge power plants.The resulting economies of scale, they argued,
would keep prices low and ensure sufficient computer power for almost any task, pro-
vided on demand.This analogy made perfect sense in an era when a single high-end
computer could cost US$100,000 or even much more.And in fact, a number of compa-
nies pursued this model in the late 1960s.A few, such as CompuServe, became very
successful.Observers anticipated that such services might eventually become public,
regulated monopoly utilities—in other words, an infrastructure (Campbell-Kelly et al.,
2014; Edwards, 2010; Greenberger, 1964).And indeed, the first 20 years of Internet history, from the late 1960s through the late
1980s, were marked by all the features of the modern infrastructural ideal: heavy govern-
ment investment, sponsored first by the US Defense Department’s Advanced Research
Projects Agency and then by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) in the public
interest.In the 1980s, the NSF forced the broad provision of Internet connections in
order to permit scientists at less well-resourced institutions to share time on the costly
supercomputers it purchased for a few major research centers—exactly the “computer
utility” model.The French Minitel system, introduced in 1980 and reaching 6.5 million
French citizens by 1990 (far more than any commercial networking service), represents
perhaps the most complete realization of the computer utility model as a public good
(Cats-Baril and Jelassi, 1994).Beginning in the late 1980s, that model was abandoned, and along with it, any notion
of public provision (although the government did retain some regulatory authority).Many factors (among them the rapid, largely unanticipated rise of personal computing)
Plantin et al.301

produced this change, yet the retreat from the modern infrastructural ideal and the rise of
neoliberalism certainly played major roles.The crucial final steps in this splintering pro-
cess were privatization of Internet backbone lines (from 1987) and deregulation (removal
of restrictions on commercial use, from 1992).Currently reaching nearly 2 billion people, the Internet—which includes the World Wide
Web and cloud computing—clearly exhibits all the features of an infrastructure.It is relia-
ble, transparent, widely shared, and visible to users mainly when it breaks down.Its many
uses are learned as part of membership in contemporary society.It provides essential ser-
vices, so much a part of commerce, government, work, and everyday life that whole socie-
ties would be crippled if some catastrophe caused it to collapse.Most governments regulate
Internet provision to some extent; some, such as Estonia, even offer universal Internet con-
nectivity as a public utility.Yet where service is splintered among many for-profit providers,
as in the United States, many low-income citizens remain excluded, and their exclusion is
both deeply consequential for them and invisible to the dominant culture.The history of networked computing resources can thus be seen as the transformation
of a traditional monopoly infrastructure model into the deregulated, privatized, and
splintered—we might say “platformized”—infrastructure model so prevalent in many
sectors today (Abbate, 1999; Edwards, 1998; Kahin and Abbate, 1995; Kahin and Keller,
1997).Computing and computer networks arguably contributed heavily to the splinter-
ing of other infrastructures as well, by permitting fine-grained, swifter, and more sophis-
ticated management of large enterprises (Castells, 2000).<mark>For example, older, more
monolithic media infrastructures such as cable TV companies are now waging battles
against emergent Internet-based “set-top box” platforms such as Apple TV, Amazon Fire,
or Google Play, which permit “‘a la carte” media provision.</mark>To summarize, the rise of ubiquitous, networked computing and changing political
sentiment have created an environment in which platforms can achieve enormous scales,
co-exist with infrastructures, and in some cases compete with or even supplant them.<mark>Platforms themselves remain a centrally designed and controlled system (Edwards et al.,
2007), but the platform ecology looks more like a network or web, linking independently
developed and maintained systems (e.g.</mark>apps).<mark>In the following section, we analyze
Facebook and Google as cases of this combined infrastructuralization of platforms and
the platformization of infrastructures.</mark><mark>Reaching out and locking in: Facebook, Google, and the
Open Web

Infrastructure studies and platform studies each provide useful analytical tools for under-
standing the fraught relationship that currently exists between the public-oriented Open
Web and locked-in “walled gardens.” We contrast Facebook and Google with the Open
Web to demonstrate the contemporary convergence of platforms and infrastructures.</mark><mark>The Open Web, Facebook, and the API

What we call here the “Open Web” refers to the original conception of World Wide Web
architecture, which was based on four technical components: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
302 new media & society 20(1)

(HTTP), uniform resource identifiers (URIs, sometimes called “locators” or uniform
resource locators [URLs]), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and hyperlinks
(encoded in HTML) (Berners-Lee and Fischetti, 1999; Jacobs and Walsh, 2004).</mark>All of
these components exist as publicly accessible, communally regulated standards (Fielding
et al., 1999).<mark>These Open Web protocols can be leveraged to do three kinds of things:

e Publish content using open standards and refer to it using open identifiers (URIs);

e Write code that facilitates access to that content by a variety of “agents” (both
humans and software robots/crawlers);

e Reuse, re-aggregate, and repurpose content to constitute new information
resources (Celik, 2010).</mark>As a result of its technically open architecture (Jacobs and Walsh, 2004), the Web is
decentralized and without technically defined or technically enforced boundaries.That
architecture, essentially a common transaction protocol (HTTP) and naming scheme
(URD, presents a flat content space permitting uniform access by humans and computa-
tional agents through browsers and other web-based apps (e.g.<mark>Google’s web crawler)
and unmediated hyperlinking.</mark>Open Web-based resources need not be free—they are
routinely created for profit and some must be paid for.<mark>Yet the Open Web is “Open”
because the technical and institutional arrangements of the system permit anyone to cre-
ate visible, findable, and linkable content that is encoded using public standards.</mark>The historical development of the Web, its feature set, and its pervasive presence are
characteristic of phenomena well-described by infrastructure studies.The Web creates
interoperability among a huge variety of distributed, heterogeneous computers and con-
tent resources.This interoperability is based on open standards that have evolved over
25 years of Web history through negotiation and incremental improvement.The Web is
effectively a global commons, largely beyond the control of any particular corporation or
government.Finally, the Web is embedded in everyday life and practice.<mark>With entertain-
ment, finance, health, education, and so much else now “on the Web,” Web access has
become as crucial to modern social life as electricity, telephones, and sewers.</mark><mark>Clearly, then, the Web is an infrastructure.</mark>Yet, the platform studies perspective also
provides crucial insights.For example, platform studies emphasizes programmability as
a defining characteristic.<mark>Advocates of the “programmable web” (Swartz, 2013) have
described how open standards such as HTTP, URIs, and HTML comprise a flexible,
extensible platform on which a myriad of applications can be built.</mark>To them, the openly
addressable content of the web constitutes a huge database that can be exploited by such
applications.!A commonplace example are news aggregators, which collect content
from numerous sites using the Rich Site Summary (RSS) open standard.Because this
programmability relies on Open Web principles, the Web-as-platform is “free, as in free
speech” (Free Software Foundation, 2016), in the sense that its protocols permit anyone
to publish, code, link to, or consume its resources, without constraints other than cost.In
its early years, much of the web’s richness and vitality stemmed from the combination of
its powers as a platform and its (then) relative independence from the economic logics of
private ownership.In its first decade, the Open Web competed directly with private
online dial-up services established in the 1980s, such as CompuServe, Prodigy, and
Plantin et al.303

American Online.Like the Minitel system in France, these walled-garden platforms pro-
vided many kinds of information and other services, but initially prevented their clients
from accessing the Internet at all.Later, they offered limited, curated sets of web- or
Internet-based resources while preventing access to the rest.Finally, after struggling to
reinvent themselves in the 2000s, the surviving companies abandoned the walled-garden
approach, which could no longer compete with the vast variety of content and services
available on the Open Web.With this history in mind, we next observe that Facebook’s huge reach and its
embeddedness in daily life lend it, too, some of the properties of infrastructure.<mark>These same properties also make Facebook a formidable force in a profit-motivated
“platformization” (Helmond, 2015), which is beginning to eat away at the founda-
tional promise of the Open Web.</mark>This platformization entails moving away from
published URIs and open HTTP transactions in favor of closed apps that undertake
hidden transactions with Facebook through a Facebook-controlled API.Like electrical sockets, APIs permit other programs to “plug in,” in order to exchange
data or perform other functions; unlike electrical sockets, however, APIs create a two-
way flow of data.<mark>In the language of infrastructure studies, an API is a gateway, permit-
ting other systems to interact with Facebook to form a seamlessly interactive network.</mark>The e-commerce companies Salesforce and eBay released web APIs as early as 2000.By
the mid-2000s, web APIs were proliferating rapidly (Flickr in 2004, Google Maps in
2005, and Twitter and Facebook in 2006).APIs are not used exclusively in commercial platforms; they are an increasingly com-
mon protocol in governmental open data initiatives.However, Langlois and Elmer
(2013) show that the Facebook API represents a double-edged sword.On one hand, it
increases the functionality of the Facebook platform by enabling an ecology of apps
using the API to exchange data with Facebook.On the other hand, the API creates nota-
ble restrictions and consequences for both app developers and users.<mark>Rather than con-
necting them to the Open Web, the API locks both groups into a landscape defined and
controlled by Facebook, A critic holds that Facebook’s turn away from the Open Web
architecture of URIs and repeatable HTTP transactions in favor of “walled gardens” is
“suffocating the Internet as we know it” (Holmes, 2013).</mark>Consider the RSS-based news aggregators mentioned above.Facebook has recently
invested significant resources to host news sources, including high-profile ones such as
the New York Times (Somaiya et al., 2015).<mark>If successful, this approach might eventually
pull some of those sites’ content out of the Open Web ecology—where it was addressable
for access and linking by an open URL and available to aggregators and other Web-based
applications such as search engines—into the Facebook ecology controlled and recorded
by the Facebook API, with potentially severe limits on access outside the boundaries of
that ecology.</mark>Of note, some of these same news sources had previously attempted their
own version of the walled-garden approach, placing their content behind paywalls.Their
current negotiations with Facebook might be said to reflect their capitulation to the plat-
form strategy—recognizing, in effect, that their stand-alone systems cannot compete
with a dominant platform ecology.Through this self-defined and self-serving walled garden, Facebook is emerging as
the social network monopoly in some markets.<mark>With an over 60% share of all social
304 new media & society 20(1)

media transactions worldwide, Facebook looks more and more like a de facto infrastruc-
ture.</mark><mark>Clearly, Facebook has long sought to embed itself in everyday life; everyone
“should” have a Facebook presence, not just for communication but for organizing and
extending one’s social relations and one’s online connectedness more generally.</mark>Facebook
works to achieve ubiquity and taken-for-grantedness not only by creating expectations
for users’ deliberate Facebook activity, such as friending people or posting photos, but
also through the many actions users perform—but never intentionally or explicitly
choose—by engaging the Facebook API.For example, when users authenticate to web-
sites or applications using their Facebook identities, the API records these acts to their
Facebook data profiles.Having access to this identity, many applications then silently
contribute to the Facebook social graph via the API, extracting data from our shopping
habits or information-seeking behavior and sending it along.Facebook then uses these
data traces to tailor advertising and adjust newsfeed priorities, among other customiza-
tions to our personalized walled gardens.<mark>Viewed simultaneously as an infrastructure and platform, Facebook presents a dis-
turbing image.</mark>As an infrastructure, Facebook is progressively expanding and embed-
ding itself in our daily existence, taking over more and more functions formerly
provided by other, less restrictive means.The API, as a gateway, transforms Facebook
from a centrally controlled system into something more like a network of indepen-
dently developed, yet seamlessly interconnected systems and services.As a proprie-
tary, largely opaque platform, Facebook filters our daily communicative acts through
a profit-extracting sieve, deploying its intimate view of users’ activities and relation-
ships for the benefit of advertisers and others, who in turn provide further data (via the
API) for the Facebook social graph.As a result, its power to shape our communication
behavior for its own ends increases.Knowledge as programmable object: Google

What role does Google play in the Internet?Consider the company’s oldest and most
basic service—search.At the time of this writing, Google accounts for over 65% of all
web searches worldwide, trailed by Bing (13%), Baidu, and Yahoo (9% each).?<mark>This
lopsided tally falls even more heavily in Google’s favor in the United States (85%) and
Europe (92%).3 Search is among the Internet’s most vital technologies, rendering Open
Web resources findable and accessible.</mark>In addition, the company provides Internet-based
applications, including those most vital to the large majority of users: email, documents,
spreadsheets, maps, YouTube videos, and cloud storage.These services have drawn
Google’s users into ever deeper reliance on its services.In recent years Google has mar-
keted these same services to businesses and universities (including one of our own), in
many cases replacing legacy licensed software from multiple providers with the suite of
Google Apps.<mark>From one perspective, then, Google looks like an infrastructure.</mark><mark>Using Open Web
protocols, it connects many independent systems into a robust, reliable network at the
level of information content (at least from the user’s viewpoint).</mark>It is embedded in the
background and widely accessible.If Google were to vanish tomorrow, large numbers of
people would find their lives substantially disrupted, with their email archives and
Plantin et al.305

addresses, documents, navigation, photos, and other critical records and services either
entirely gone or requiring substantial effort to reconstruct.<mark>The company’s unprecedented
dominance across Europe has led to a European Union antitrust investigation.4 For good
or ill, Google’s near-monopoly on search creates a uniform, invisible, and robust infra-
structure for accessing the vast store of knowledge and information on the Open Web.</mark><mark>On the other hand, looking at Google through the lens of platform studies highlights
programmability as the very basis of Google’s success.</mark><mark>Like other Web 2.0 phenomena,
Google’s systems are “native web application[s], never sold or packaged, but delivered
as a service” (O’Reilly, 2005).</mark>The Web 2.0 model is based on connecting actors and
content, permitting the construction of new web-based applications.A revealing example
is the case of digital maps (Plantin, 2015).Digital cartography originally required spe-
cialized geographic information systems (GIS) software and access to national govern-
ment maps (such as Ordnance Survey in the United Kingdom or IGN in France) or maps
from an aerial imagery company (such as Teleatlas or Navteq).Reuse of maps was hin-
dered by high cost, complex technical architectures, and strict copyright.In 2005, Google
released Google Maps and almost immediately provided an API.<mark>The API permitted third
parties to add or overlay other data onto the Google base map, thus creating mapping
“mashups.” In other words, Google transformed maps into programmable objects, with
Google Maps as the platform.</mark>Similar examples are proliferated via the addition of APIs
to most Google products.<mark>As with Facebook, the principal benefits to Google are the user
activity data returned by the API and the ubiquity of its branded interface, while the
myriad applications connected to the Google platform benefit from the ability to build on
Google-provided data.</mark><mark>Seen as a platform, Google presents issues similar to Facebook.</mark>Because it designs
and controls Internet search, the company holds enormous power over the visibility of
web-based resources.<mark>While Google (to its credit) goes to considerable lengths to prevent
the gaming of its search algorithms—for instance, Google asserts that no one can pay to
increase a web page’s rank, except via “sponsored links” clearly labeled as such—many
strategies exist for raising that rank.</mark>Some companies’ entire business consists of helping
others improve their position in Google search results.Given that other search platforms,
such as Baidu, appear to permit even greater outside influence over their algorithms—in
Baidu’s case, greatly restricting the prevalence of results from sources outside China—
Google is perhaps the “lesser evil,” but its profit-driven private near-monopoly still
remains a substantial concern (Jiang, 2014).<mark>Both infrastructure and platform perspectives also shed light on the Google Books
project.> Starting in 2004, Google partnered with major research universities to digitize
“every” book.</mark>Google presented the project as a 21st-century update of the public and
national libraries.Seen in that light, the project looked like knowledge infrastructure—
and in the abstract, it could be so, opening vast new possibilities for knowledge access
and discovery, including for poor and under-resourced people and regions.<mark>Yet, Google
Books was immediately and tightly bound to Google’s platform logic.</mark>For example,
Google purchased reCAPTCHA (based on the CAPTCHA technology, that stands for
Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) in 2009
partly to rely on crowdsourcing to decipher characters that could not be recognized
through automated optical character recognition (OCR).<mark>It also released a Google Books
306 new media & society 20(1)

API (with its attendant two-way flow of data) and allowed researchers to build applica-
tions on top of it.° Immediately entangled in lawsuits initiated by publishers, authors, and
others, Google Books has not (yet) achieved its promise as a universal digital library;
instead, other stakeholders correctly saw the project as Google’s attempt to platformize
the library, a major knowledge infrastructure.</mark><mark>As with Facebook, Google’s platform logic creates real benefits for both users and
third-party developers.</mark>First, in an age of government downsizing, what other organiza-
tion could fund or execute such a colossal effort?Second, the ability not only to access
all that knowledge but also to build upon Google’s code avoids redundant effort and
expense.Yet the fact remains that control of the platform puts Google in an unparalleled
position of dominance, increasing its power to shape lives as well as knowledge.<mark>As this section has shown, infrastructure studies and platform studies both make
important contributions to understanding our rapidly changing networked digital land-
scape.</mark>Together, they help us to see the structures, the promises, and the perils of a world
where (some) platforms become infrastructures, even as (many) infrastructures are being
platformized.In such a world, it has become too easy to conflate the economic logics
typical of platforms with the public interests and quasi-universal services formerly char-
acteristic of many infrastructures.The question is not only who profits and controls, but
who, and what, is cast aside along the way.<mark>Conclusion

This article has examined two theoretical approaches relevant to the study of new media
forms: infrastructure studies and platform studies.</mark>The constructs they address share cer-
tain notable properties, including embeddedness, a degree of invisibility, extensibility,
and broad coverage.While in this manner the two theories are “joined at the hip,” they
are simultaneously “genetically different,” emerging from different disciplinary con-
texts, traditionally focusing on different objects of investigation, and emphasizing differ-
ent facets of their objects of study.<mark>Through case studies of Google, Facebook, and the Open Web, we have shown that
rather than distinguishing two entirely separate objects, these approaches instead offer
different lenses on phenomena fundamental to everyday life in contemporary societies.</mark>We argued that an accommodation of these two lenses—a kind of theoretical bifocal—
helps us to historically and critically understand how these societies are being trans-
formed.<mark>With the rise of neoliberal economics in the 1970s came a “splintering” of the
“modern infrastructural ideal” of universal service delivered by monopoly providers
(Graham and Marvin, 2001).</mark>Digital technologies greatly assisted in this process, often
making possible lower cost, more dynamic, and more competitive alternatives to govern-
mental or quasi-governmental monopoly infrastructures, in exchange for a transfer of
wealth and responsibility to private enterprises.<mark>The result has been what we called a
“platformization of infrastructures.” At the same time, the rise of platform strategies in
the computer industry, and later in “Web 2.0” systems and services, made possible an
“infrastructuralization of platforms.” Google, Facebook, and a handful of other corporate
giants have learned to exploit the power of platforms—which hold undeniable benefits
for both users and smaller, independent application developers—to gain footholds as the

modern-day equivalents of the railroad, telephone, and electric utility monopolies of the
late 19th and the 20th centuries.How might scholars of these two approaches make use of our theoretical bifocal,
platform-as-infrastructure, and vice versa?Certainly, they would retain the valuable
historical perspective of infrastructure studies.But rather than presuppose the slow
evolution and eventual stability plateau characteristic of physical, capital-intensive
infrastructures, they might also take account of how rapidly “infrastructuralized plat-
forms” have arisen in the digital age.Similarly, they might explore how information
technology (IT) has helped to platformize even capital-intensive industries such as the
transport of documents and goods; for example, FedEx and United Parcel Service
(UPS) both grew mighty through relentless application of IT to logistics.In all cases,
scholars of infrastructure could attend to the technological influences and policy alter-
natives that tip the delicate balance between the public interest and corporate power.It
would recover the goal of comparative analysis that is often missing from some
accounts of single platforms.It would recognize that the “system builders” that domi-
nated infrastructures of the past may be replaced by “ecosystem-builders” that lever-
age programmability and interconnection to achieve control, rather than relying on
direct provision and expansion.We hope to foster scholarship describing conflicts or subductions between infrastruc-
tures and platforms across various sectors, possibly building on the table provided in this
article.An example of such case study could be the impact of commercial platforms
(such as Academia.edu or ResearchGate) on existing scholarly communication infra-
structures.Another is the increasing reliance of “smart city” administration on private
platforms to monitor public services and urban activity.This combined perspective, one
might hope, would reassert the importance of widely available, universal, and relatively
stable infrastructure as a foundation of social justice.While the private sector’s constant
churn of exciting new technical developments has added so much to the quality of life,
its total infiltration of basic needs also imposes potentially dire political, environmental,
and ethical risks.Funding
